## Guiding Questions

Question 1: How does mortgage lending approvals, denials, and interest rates look for applicants of 
different income levels but within the same census tract?
```{r mortgage denial rates}

# USE https://revealnews.org/article/how-we-identified-lending-disparities-in-federal-mortgage-data/ FOR METHODOLOGY!!!!
tmap_mode("view")
censusapps <- clean_hmda %>%
  # create total number of apps by race and year:
  group_by(NAME, year, derived_race) %>%
  summarise(n_census_apps = n())
# denials <- clean_hmda %>%
#   # create n_denied apps
#   filter(action_taken == "3") %>%
#   group_by(NAME, year, derived_race) %>%
#   summarise(denied_apps = n())


# JOINING IS CAUSING ISSUE. DUPLICATES OF NAME, YEAR, RACE.
#  may need to merge tracts df at end right before mapping?
sf_hmda <- st_join(clean_hmda,
                   censusapps,
                   left = TRUE)

  # mutate(denial_rate = denied_apps/n_census_apps) %>%
  # filter(year == "2018") %>%
  # tm_shape() +
  # tm_polygons(col = "denial_rate")

sf_hmda %>%
  filter(year == "2018") %>%
  tm_shape() +
  tm_polygons(col = "n_census_apps")

```



```{r interest rates}

# # NONE OF THE CODE IS WORKING
# # 2018
# q1 <- 
#   merge[!(is.na(merge$interest_rate)), ] %>%
#   filter(interest_rate != "exempt") %>%
#   filter(interest_rate <= "12")
# 
# mean(q1$interest_rate)
# q1 %>%
#   filter(year == "2018") %>%
#   mean(interest_rate)
# median(q1$interest_rate)
# 
# # q1 %>%
# #   summarise(count = sum(is.na(interest_rate)))
  
```


Question 2: Do racial identities of applicants match their applications and what the lender reported?

Question 3: Which census tracts are most vulnerable to lending deserts?

Question 4: How does mortgage lending approvals and denials compare across lower land costs and higher land costs in census tracts?

Question 5: How does increasing wealth disparities impact mortgage lending within a census tract 
over time?
